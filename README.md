*GeekTrust Problem Set 5*

## How to Run:

#### for Problem one:

```

>>> d = GoldenCrown()

>>> d.allies()
```

#### for Problem two

```
$ python

>>> from problem_two import BreakerOfChains

>>> s = BreakerOfChains()

>>> s.ruler()
```
##  

1) Both the problem sets are done using Python3

2) Each has the given set of question to be asked

  

3) Sample Input/Output data

6) Following things are majorly used:
	i) dictionary,
	ii) list,
	iii) list comprehension,
	iv) file input for message
	v) declared functions,

About the test:

Problem 1 Has to evaluate who are the Allies of King Shah, if the right message is sent the Allies will support the King.

  

Problem 2 Has to evaluate the kingdom with maximum number of allies, where a message chosen randomly if sent to the right allies, they will give the support to the sender kingdom, given that the Allies are not participating and have not already given their support to the other allies.
